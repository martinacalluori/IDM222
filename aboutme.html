					My name is Martina Calluori, in 2015 I graduated from Bethlehem Catholic High School, and went on my way to Drexel University. I got to Drexel and found very quickly that I was in a place that I have wanted to be my whole life. I am an Interactive Digital Media Major and I think choosing that major was one of the best decisions of my life. Here, I am able to pursue my interests in design and code, and feed my passion for creating.

					To know a little about my personal life, I have a dog named Bentley and he has been my best friend for 13 years. I have a mom and a dad, and two great step parents, and between the four of them they raised me. I have two step sisters between my mom and my step dad, they're 25 and 29. Animals are super important to me and a lot of my creativity and inspiration comes from them. Also, I have a lot of plants. I have two cacti, and 9 various types of succulents that I love and care for every day.
